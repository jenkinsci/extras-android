This determines how long the Android Emulator plugin should delay for, at the start of a build, before attempting to launch the emulator.
<p>
This is useful, for example, if starting the emulator depends on other Build Environment plugins that need time to fully start up.<br/>
e.g. If you find that starting a VNC server using the <a href="">Xvnc plugin</a> can take 30 seconds &mdash; due to slow hardware, or a large X startup script &mdash; you would enter 30 (or more) here.
