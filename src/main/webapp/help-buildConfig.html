  Select this option if you wish to automatically start an Android emulator of your choice before
  the build steps execute, with the emulator being stopped after building is complete.
<p>
  You can choose to start a pre-defined, existing Android emulator instance (also known as an
  <strong>A</strong>ndroid <strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>D</strong>evice, or AVD).<br/>
  Alternatively, the plugin can automatically create a new emulator on the build slave with
  properties you specify here.

  In any case, the &quot;logcat&quot; output will automatically be captured and archived.
