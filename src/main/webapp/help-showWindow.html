If this option is selected, the Android emulator user interface will be displayed on screen during the build.<br/>
Untick this option if you do not want the emulator to be visible while it runs.
<p>
Disabling this is useful, for example, on Linux machines that do not have a graphical user interface.<br/>
If you <em>do</em> require the emulator to be displayed on such machines, you can install and enable the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Xvnc+Plugin">Xvnc plugin</a>.<br/>
With Xvnc enabled for the build, you can keep this option selected and the emulator will be launched in a VNC session.
